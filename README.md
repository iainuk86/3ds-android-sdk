# 📱 🔒 3-D Secure Android SDK Component 🔒 📱

This is intended to be a fully compliant mobile SDK for use in the [3-D Secure protocol.](https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3-d-secure/)  
3-D Secure is an online payment authentication protocol, overseen by EMVCo, consisting of major card-chemes - Visa, Mastercard, AMEX etc.  
Its usage is becoming increasingly more important in reducing fraud and is becoming mandated in various countries around the world.  
There are several different products that communicate throughout the whole 3-D Secure process, this SDK would be one of them.  
Any merchant that wants to take payments through their app can use this SDK and be assured that their payments are 3-D Secure compliant.

I originally intended to make this fully compliant and certified, until EMVCo provided their pricing for compliance.  
I have intentions of eventually making this an open-source project, so anyone that wants to build an SDK can use it as a basis.

# 🛠️ Implementation 🛠️

Written in pure Java.  
Various Android development strategies were necessary as it involves retrieving internal data from the device.

# 🔜 Coming Soon ⚠️
- An iOS version for Apple devices
- I plan to convert the Java code to Kotlin
